602,"<div id='div1'><p>To study, you need to lock in.</p> <p>To lock in, you need to focus and you need to get rid of distractions.</p> <p>Here are some tools that help with that.</p> <h2>Getting rid of Distractions</h2> <p>The two following tools are designed specifically for Windows and macOS operating systems.</p> <ul> <li><strong>""Cold Turkey""</strong> is a productivity software that helps users limit their digital distractions by blocking access to time-wasting websites, apps, and games. It's recommended for increasing focus, reducing procrastination, and promoting healthy work habits by enforcing self-discipline and preventing online distractions. You can download it here: <a href=""https://getcoldturkey.com/"">https://getcoldturkey.com/</a></li> <li><strong>""Micromanager""</strong> software, created by the same maker as ""Cold Turkey,"" restricts access to non-essential apps, allowing only whitelisted ones for enhanced productivity. It prevents multitasking, promotes focused work, and minimizes distractions. An example of use:  you can use this software to block yourself from leaving the Anki app for one to two hours, thereby eliminating distractions. This software, combined with the <em>Speed Focus Mode</em> add-on for Anki, is very effective in boosting your focus during your study sessions. You can download it here: <a href=""https://getcoldturkey.com/micromanager/"">https://getcoldturkey.com/micromanager/</a></li> <li>There are apps for Android that serve a similar purpose. Such as the app called ""Stay Focused"": <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stayfocused"">Stay Focused:  Site & App Block - Apps on Google Play</a></li> <li>Do some research and find what distractions-blocking app best suits you.</li> </ul> <h2>Improving Anki with Addons</h2> <p><strong>What are Anki add-ons?</strong> Anki add-ons are extra tools that you can add to the Anki flashcard app. They give you more options and features to personalize your studying. With add-ons, you can change how the app looks, add new types of flashcards, automate tasks, and connect with external resources. They help you customize Anki to fit your learning style and make studying more effective.</p> <p><strong>Where can I install Anki add-ons?</strong> Anki is available on the following platforms: </p> <ul> <li>Anki Desktop for Windows, macOS, and Linux.</li> <li>AnkiMobile for iOS devices.</li> <li>AnkiDroid for Android devices.</li> <li>AnkiWeb, which is a web-based interface accessible through a browser.</li> </ul> <p>But Anki addons are available for <strong>Anki Desktop</strong> only.</p> <p>I should mention that I have no affiliation with the developers of Anki. I only make decks and share them.</p> <p><strong>What add-ons do you recommend?</strong> This add-on helps you focus when you're studying, and I think it's a <em>must have</em>: <a href=""https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1046608507"">Speed Focus Mode (auto-alert, auto-reveal, auto-answer) - AnkiWeb</a></p> <p>The first version of this addon was actually commissioned by me, then it became a very popular add-on.</p> <p>These add-ons allow you to add audio to the cards of a deck. I recommend them if you want audio on all cards, or if you wish to try out different voices for a deck: </p> <ul> <li><a href=""https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/111623432"">HyperTTS - Add speech to your flashcards - AnkiWeb</a></li> <li><a href=""https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1436550454"">AwesomeTTS - Add speech to your flashcards - AnkiWeb</a></li> </ul> <p><em>AwesomeTTS</em> is better if you wish to add audio for many cards all at once, as <em>HyperTTS</em> may crash when selecting over 1000 cards.</p> <p>This add-on allows you to use a gamepad/joystick to study on Anki. It makes study more <em>a lot</em> more comfortable: <a href=""https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1898790263"">Contanki - Controller Support for Anki (beta) - AnkiWeb</a></p> <p>For the sentences deck, it's very useful to have a shortcut to suspend a card.</p> <p>To <em>suspend a card</em> means:  remove that card from the deck. It's useful to have a shortcut to suspend a card because you're supposed to remove cards that are too easy for you, or cards that teach you nothing new.</p> <p>You can configure this add-on to have a joystick shortcut to suspend the card: </p> <ul> <li>When you install this add-on, go to the main screen of Anki, click Tools → Controller Options → Add → In the Action column, type 'Suspend', in the Shortcut column type '@' → click 'Controls' → click 'Review' → select the RB button (or whichever button you prefer) → select 'Suspend' → click 'Save'.</li> </ul> <p>This will add a shortcut that suspends the card whenever you press the RB button in your joystick.</p> <p>You should suspend: </p> <ul> <li>cards that are repeated</li> <li>cards that are too easy for you</li> <li>cards that contain nothing new to you (for example:  no new vocabulary, no new word pattern)</li> </ul> <p>You should remove or suspend those cards, otherwise your <em>'due reviews'</em> will pile up to a big number.</p> <p>This add-on shows a little pop-up confirming which option you picked <em>(Again/Good/Hard/Easy)</em>. It goes well with the previous add-on that I recommended, because it lets you know you selected the right option: <a href=""https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1084228676"">Color Confirmation - AnkiWeb</a></p> <p>And finally there is this add-on. I configure it in a way, that the ratings history shows on the front of the card. That way, when I see many <i>again's</i> in the card rating history, I know that I must think <i>well</i> before answering. I think it's very useful:  <a href=""https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1906641654"">See Previous Card Ratings in Reviewer</a></p> <hr> <p>These are some of my favorite tools, and they have been incredibly useful to me. I hope they can be just as helpful to you.</p> <p>Feel free to follow me on X:  <a href=""https://x.com/eng_neribrandao"">@eng_neribrandao</a></p></div>",601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,30.00
